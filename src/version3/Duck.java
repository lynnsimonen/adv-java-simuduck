/**
 * SimUDuck Version 3. Joe realized that concrete ("implementation") inheritance
 * probably wasn't the answer because he just got a memo that says that the
 * executives now want to update the product every six months (in ways they
 * haven't yet decided on). Joe knows the spec will keep changing and he'll be
 * forced to look at and possibly override fly() and quack() for every new Duck
 * subclass that's ever added to the program ... forever!
 *
 * So he needs a cleaner way to have only some, but not all, of the duck types
 * fly or quack. So he moves the quack() and fly() methods into interfaces.
 *
 * @version 2.00
