About Version 7
------------------
The key difference in this version is that we make the program a bit more realistic by using a GUI to change fly and quack behaviors at runtime. Changing behavior at runtime is one of the most powerful things you can do with the DIP/Strategy Pattern.

Please note: you are not expected to understand GUI development at this point. However, by showing you how a GUI class can change fly and quack behaviors based on user input, we provide this sample code. This would not be possible without the DIP and Strategy Pattern.
