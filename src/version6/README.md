About Version 6
------------------
The key difference in this fix compared to Version 5 in Chapter 1 of your book is that none of the best practices are violated. Furthermore, only pure abstractions (DIP compliant) in the form of interfaces are used.

And we use multiple interfaces, so that we can categorize our ducks differently. A big problem in the book is that ducks that can't do things like fly or quack still have fly and quack methods. This doesn't make sense. If a duck can't fly it shouldn't have a fly method. Remember, methods represent "behaviors" that objects have. To solve this problem we use an interface inheritance hierarchy to give ducks varying behaviors. All ducks, for example can display themselves, so all ducks inherit from the "DuckGroup" interface. But only some ducks can fly, so those ducks inherit from the "FlyGroup" interface, which in turn extends the DuckGroup interface. This means that a duck who can fly can also display itself. Some ducks can fly and quack, so those ducks inherit from the "PerformAllGroup" interface. This interface inherits from all other interfaces, meaning a duck will have all possible behaviors.

Now, if we want to work with a group of ducks who can fly, we simply create an array of FlyGroup ducks and they are all interchangeable with each other with respect to flying ability as well as display ability, but not necessarily quacking ability.

Or, if we want ducks who can display themselves, but not necessary fly or quack, we can create an array of "DuckGroup" ducks and ask them to display. They will be interchangeable.

By using multiple interfaces we can treat any group of ducks in any way that we want. Those behaviors become components that can be used to delete work to (the low-level objects in the DIP). And because multiple ducks share some of the same components, should a component need to be altered, we only have to make those changes in one place -- in the component class. All ducks that have that component automatically benefit from the change.
