/**
 * Starting point for a duck pond simulation game: SimUDuck. The game can show a
 * large variety of duck species swimming and making quacking sounds. The
 * initial designers used standard OOP techniques and created an abstract Duck
 * superclass (this class) from which all other duck types inherit.
 *
 * This is a good example of how Abstract classes can be used effectively: a
 * combination of methods are needed in the child classes. Two of these, quack()
 * and swim() have implementations, the assumption being that all child classes
 * will need these implementations. But one method is abstract. No
 * implementation is provided because each child class (duck) will display
 * itself differently (some may be in color, some black and white, and they all
 * look different.
 *
 * Furthermore, the class is declared abstract because we don't want programmers
 * using this class to create direct instances. We only want instances created
 * from specific sub classes, because only those classes have enough distinct
 * properties and methods to be useful. So this is a form of developer control.
 *
 * The question is, "is this the best architecture for a duck simulation game?"
 *
 * @version 1.01
